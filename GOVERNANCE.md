# Cluster API Provider for Bring Your Own Host Governance

This document defines the project governance for Cluster API Provider for Bring Your Own Host.

## Overview

**Cluster API Provider for Bring Your Own Host** is committed to building an open, inclusive, productive and
self-governing open source community focused on building a high-quality
[Cluster API Provider](https://cluster-api.sigs.k8s.io/developer/providers/implementers-guide/overview.html). The
community is governed by this document which defines how all members should work
together to achieve this goal.

## Code of Conduct

The Bring Your Own Host community abides by this [code of conduct](CODE-OF-CONDUCT.md).

## Community Roles

* **Users:** Members that engage with the Bring Your Own Host community via any medium
  (Slack, GitHub, mailing lists, etc.).
* **Contributors:** Do regular contributions to the Bring Your Own Host project
  (documentation, code reviews, responding to issues, participating in proposal
  discussions, contributing code, etc.).
* **Maintainers**: Responsible for the overall health and direction of the
  project. They are the final reviewers of PRs and responsible for Bring Your Own Host
  releases.

### Contributors

Anyone can contribute to the project (e.g. open a PR) as long as they follow the
guidelines in [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md).


### Maintainers

The list of current maintainers can be found in
[MAINTAINERS.md](MAINTAINERS.md).

While anyone can review a PR and is encouraged to do so, only maintainers are
allowed to merge the PR. To maintain velocity, two approvals (either maintainers or reviewers) are
required to merge a given PR. In case of a disagreement between maintainers, a
vote should be called (on GitHub or Slack) and a simple majority is required in
order for the PR to be merged.

New maintainers must be nominated from contributors by an existing maintainer
and must be elected by a [supermajority](#supermajority) of the current
maintainers. Likewise, maintainers can be removed by a supermajority of the
maintainers or can resign by notifying the maintainers.

### Supermajority

A supermajority is defined as two-thirds of members in the group.

## Code of Conduct

The code of conduct is overseen by the Bring Your Own Host project maintainers. Possible code
of conduct violations should be emailed to the project maintainers.

If the possible violation is against one of the project maintainers that member
will be recused from voting on the issue.

## Updating Governance

All substantive changes in Governance require a supermajority vote of the
maintainers.
