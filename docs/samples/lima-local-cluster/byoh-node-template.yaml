# BASIC CONFIGURATION
# ===================================================================== #

# Arch: "default", "x86_64", "aarch64".
# "default" corresponds to the host architecture.
arch: "x86_64"

# An image must support systemd and cloud-init.
# Ubuntu and Fedora are known to work.
# Default: none (must be specified)
images:
  # Image is set to focal (20.04 LTS) for long-term stability
  # Hint: run `limactl prune` to invalidate the "current" cache
  - location: "https://cloud-images.ubuntu.com/focal/current/focal-server-cloudimg-amd64.img"

  - location: "https://cloud-images.ubuntu.com/focal/current/focal-server-cloudimg-arm64.img"
    arch: "aarch64"

# CPUs: if you see performance issues, try limiting cpus to 1.
# Default: 4
cpus: 4

# Memory size
# Default: "4GiB"
memory: "6GiB"

# Disk size
# Default: "100GiB"
disk: "100GiB"

# Expose host directories to the guest
# Default: none
mounts:
  - location: "~"
    # CAUTION: `writable` SHOULD be false for the home directory.
    # Setting `writable` to true is possible, but untested and dangerous.
    writable: false
  - location: "/tmp/lima"
    writable: true

ssh:
  # A localhost port of the host. Forwarded to port 22 of the guest.
  # Currently, this port number has to be specified manually.
  # Default: none
  localPort: 0
  # Load ~/.ssh/*.pub in addition to $LIMA_HOME/_config/user.pub .
  # This option is useful when you want to use other SSH-based
  # applications such as rsync with the Lima instance.
  # If you have an insecure key under ~/.ssh, do not use this option.
  # Default: true
  loadDotSSHPubKeys: true

containerd:
  # Enable system-wide (aka rootful)  containerd and its dependencies (BuildKit, Stargz Snapshotter)
  # Default: false

  # Enable user-scoped (aka rootless) containerd and its dependencies
  # Default: true
  user: false

firmware:
  # Use legacy BIOS instead of UEFI.
  # Default: false
  legacyBIOS: false

video:
  # QEMU display, e.g., "none", "cocoa", "sdl".
  # As of QEMU v5.2, enabling this is known to have negative impact

networks:

# Port forwarding rules. Forwarding between ports 22 and ssh.localPort cannot be overridden.
# Rules are checked sequentially until the first one matches.
# portForwards:
#   - guestPort: 443
#     hostIP: "0.0.0.0" # overrides the default value "127.0.0.1"; allows privileged port forwarding
#   # default: hostPort: 443 (same as guestPort)
#   # default: guestIP: "127.0.0.1" (also matches bind addresses "0.0.0.0", "::", and "::1")
#   # default: proto: "tcp" (only valid value right now)
#   - guestPortRange: [4000, 4999]
#     hostIP:  "0.0.0.0" # overrides the default value "127.0.0.1"
#   # default: hostPortRange: [4000, 4999] (must specify same number of ports as guestPortRange)
#   - guestPort: 80
#     hostPort: 8080 # overrides the default value 80
#   - guestIP: "127.0.0.2" # overrides the default value "127.0.0.1"
#     hostIP: "127.0.0.2" # overrides the default value "127.0.0.1"
#   # default: guestPortRange: [1024, 65535]
#   # default: hostPortRange: [1024, 65535]
#   - guestPort: 8888
#     ignore: true (don't forward this port)
#   # Lima internally appends this fallback rule at the end:
#   - guestIP: "127.0.0.1"
#     guestPortRange: [1024, 65535]
#     hostIP: "127.0.0.1"
#     hostPortRange: [1024, 65535]
#   # Any port still not matched by a rule will not be forwarded (ignored)

# Extra environment variables that will be loaded into the VM at start up.
# These variables are currently only consumed by internal init scripts, not by the user shell.
# This field is experimental and may change in a future release of Lima.
